The TDD Survey 2024 is a community-driven initiative that collects data on the real-world practices of Test-Driven Development (TDD). The goal of this project is to gather insights from developers and teams globally to shape the future of TDD, providing a better understanding of how it is practiced and evolving within the industry.

## The history

The TDD landscape has always been a space of experimentation, learning, and growth. Our journey with the TDD Survey began in [2021](https://thestateoftdd.org/results/2021), starting as a small initiative aimed at understanding how developers were adopting Test-Driven Development and the challenges they faced. That first edition helped us collect key insights, including common TDD practices as well as identifying anti-patterns—behaviors and practices that hinder the proper use of TDD.

In [2022](https://thestateoftdd.org/results/2022), the second edition expanded on these findings, diving deeper into both the successes and the struggles teams encountered while implementing TDD in real-world projects. We learned more about the conditions under which TDD thrives, as well as when and why it often fails to deliver expected results. Each response contributed valuable insights into the evolving practices of TDD across diverse teams and projects, helping us uncover actionable trends.

However, 2023 was a year without data collection. This break gave us time to reflect on our previous findings and strategize on how to make the next edition even more impactful. Now, in 2024, we’re proud to introduce the biggest and most ambitious edition of the TDD survey to date.

## Methodology

We use a survey based approach. All responses are collected anonymously. The data is aggregated and analyzed to identify trends, challenges,
and best practices in TDD. The results are published in an open-source report, available to the community. Individual responses
will never be shared or sold.
