As the software development landscape evolves, Test-Driven Development (TDD) continues to play a crucial role in ensuring high-quality, maintainable code. But as more teams adopt or refine their TDD practices, it’s important to understand the real-world challenges and successes developers face.

Our 2024 TDD survey aims to collect insights from developers, testers, and teams across the globe to:

- Identify current trends in TDD adoption and usage.
- Highlight common obstacles and success factors in TDD workflows.
- Gather best practices that help teams deliver more efficient and bug-free software.

By participating, you’re contributing to a larger body of knowledge that will help the global development community refine and improve their TDD practices. Your input will be used to create a comprehensive report that will benefit both newcomers and experienced practitioners, fostering more effective and sustainable development processes.

*Together, we can shape the future of TDD.*
